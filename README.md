This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java that can lead to an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. The bug is present in the `Bug.java` file and the corrected code is in the `BugSolution.java` file.  The error is caused by an incorrect loop condition in array traversal. The solution involves modifying the loop condition to prevent accessing an index beyond the array bounds.
